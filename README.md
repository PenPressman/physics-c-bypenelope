This website is part of a project called Phys by Pen, in which I (Penelope Pressman) aim to make physics learning more accessible and fun for anyone who wants to explore. This site is focused on helping high school students, mostly sophomores, juniors, and seniors, with AP Physics C: Mech and Electrostatics & Magnetism. Phys by Pen will be helpful for those looking for study help, practice, or formulas and information about AP physics. I'm incorperating resources for thermodynamics, quantum, and optics (slowly), so those will be increasingly available asap.
