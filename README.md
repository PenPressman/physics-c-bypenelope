This website is part of a projet called Phys by Pen, in which I (Penelope Pressman) aim to make physics learning more accessible and fun for anyone who wants to explore. This site is focused on helping high school students, mostly sophomores, juniors, and seniors, with AP Physics C: Electrostatics and Magnetism. Phys by Pen will be helpful for those looking for study help, practice, or formulas and information about AP physics.
