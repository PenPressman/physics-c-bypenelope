  {
    "concept": "Work",
    "explanation": "Work is done when a force moves something through a distance. No movement = no work, even if you’re pushing hard!"
  },
  {
    "concept": "Work Formula",
    "explanation": "Work = Force × distance × cos(θ). The angle matters! Only the force in the direction of motion counts."
  },
  {
    "concept": "Positive vs Negative Work",
    "explanation": "If a force helps motion, work is positive. If it fights motion, work is negative. Think pushing vs resisting."
  },
  {
    "concept": "Power",
    "explanation": "Power is how fast work is done. More power = same work in less time. Measured in watts."
  },
  {
    "concept": "Conservation of Energy",
    "explanation": "Energy can’t be created or destroyed—just transferred or transformed. The total stays constant if no outside forces do work."
  },
  {
    "concept": "Mechanical Energy",
    "explanation": "This is the sum of kinetic and potential energy. It stays constant in ideal systems (no friction or outside work)."
  },
  {
    "concept": "Gravitational Potential Energy",
    "explanation": "Energy stored based on height. More height = more potential to fall and gain speed."
  },

    "concept": "Elastic Potential Energy",
    "explanation": "Energy stored in stretched or compressed springs. Depends on the spring constant and how far it's displaced."
  },
  {
    "concept": "Thermal Energy",
    "explanation": "This is often 'lost' energy in physics problems—it’s where friction or drag puts the energy."
  },
  {
    "concept": "Efficiency",
    "explanation": "Efficiency = useful energy out ÷ total energy in. Real machines always have losses—efficiency < 100%."
  },
  {
    "concept": "Momentum Conservation",
    "explanation": "If no external force acts, momentum stays the same before and after a collision—even if objects bounce or stick."
  },
  {
    "concept": "Elastic Collision",
    "explanation": "Both momentum and kinetic energy are conserved. Think ideal bouncy ball or air hockey puck."
  },
  {
    "concept": "Inelastic Collision",
    "explanation": "Momentum is conserved, but kinetic energy isn’t. Some energy becomes heat, sound, etc."
  },
  {
    "concept": "Perfectly Inelastic Collision",
    "explanation": "This is when objects stick together after colliding. Momentum’s still conserved, but they move as one after."
  },
  {
    "concept": "Impulse",
    "explanation": "Impulse = change in momentum. You can also get it from force × time. Longer contact time = smaller force needed."
  },
  {
    "concept": "Impulse-Momentum Theorem",
    "explanation": "Impulse causes momentum change. Use this when you have time and force instead of just speeds."

    "explanation": "When something launches something else, like a gun firing a bullet, both objects feel equal and opposite momentum."
  },
  {
    "concept": "Tension",
    "explanation": "A pulling force from a rope, string, or cable. Tension’s the same throughout if the rope is light and there’s no friction."
  },
  {
    "concept": "Torque",
    "explanation": "A force that causes rotation. Depends on how hard you push *and* how far from the pivot you push."
  },
  {
    "concept": "Torque Formula",
    "explanation": "Torque = r × F × sin(θ). Maximum torque happens when you push perpendicular to the lever arm."
  },
  {
    "concept": "Rotational Equilibrium",
    "explanation": "If all the torques cancel out, there’s no angular acceleration. The object doesn’t spin faster or slower."
  },
  {
    "concept": "Center of Mass",
    "explanation": "The average location of mass in an object. It’s where you balance something if you want it to stay level."
  },
  {
    "concept": "Lever Arm",
    "explanation": "The distance from the pivot point to where the force is applied. Longer = more torque for the same force."
  },
  {
    "concept": "Rotational Inertia",
    "explanation": "This is like regular inertia, but for spinning. More mass, or mass farther from the axis = harder to spin."
  },
  {
    "concept": "Angular Momentum",
    "explanation": "Momentum, but for rotation. It’s conserved if no external torques act. Think figure skaters pulling in their arms."

    "concept": "Translational vs Rotational Motion",
    "explanation": "Translational = moving from one spot to another. Rotational = spinning. Objects can do both at once."

    "concept": "Orbital Speed",
    "explanation": "Speed needed to stay in orbit. It balances gravity pulling inward with inertia moving forward."
