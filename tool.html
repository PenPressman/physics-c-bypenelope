  { "concept": "Rotational Inertia",
    "explanation": "Also called moment of inertia, it tells you how hard it is to spin something. More mass far from the axis = harder to spin."
  },
  {
    "concept": "Angular Momentum",
    "explanation": "It’s like momentum, but for spinning. Bigger radius or faster spin means more angular momentum—and it’s conserved unless a torque acts."
  },
  {
    "concept": "Doppler Effect",
    "explanation": "That high-pitch siren sound coming toward you? Lower when it passes? That’s Doppler."

  },
  {
    "concept": "Equilibrium",
    "explanation": "When the net force on an object is zero, it's in equilibrium. That includes constant velocity *or* staying still—basically no acceleration."
  },
  {
    "concept": "Newton’s First Law",
    "explanation": "An object will stay at rest or move in a straight line at constant speed unless something unbalanced pushes or pulls on it."
  },
  {
    "concept": "Inertia",

  },
  {
    "concept": "Free Body Diagram",

  },

  {
    "concept": "Apparent Weight",
    "explanation": "This is what you 'feel' as your weight, aka the normal force. It can be more or less than mg depending on acceleration."
  },
  
  {
    "concept": "Contact Force",
    "explanation": "Forces that happen from direct touching—like tension, normal force, friction. If two things touch, there’s at least one."
  },
  {
    "concept": "Field Force",
    "explanation": "Forces that act at a distance—like gravity, electric, or magnetic. They don’t need touching to work."
  },

  },
  {
    "concept": "Dynamic Equilibrium",
    "explanation": "Forces are balanced, but the object is moving at constant velocity. No net force doesn’t mean no motion!"
  },
  {
    "concept": "Weight vs Mass",
    "explanation": "Mass is how much stuff you have. Weight is the force of gravity pulling on it. On the moon, your mass stays the same but your weight changes."
  },
  {
    "concept": "Friction Direction",
    "explanation": "Friction always resists the direction of intended relative motion, not necessarily movement. It can actually point forward—like when you walk."
  },
  {
    "concept": "Coefficient of Friction",
    "explanation": "This is a value that tells you how grippy two surfaces are. Higher = more friction."
  },

  {
    "concept": "Inclined Plane Components",
    "explanation": "On a ramp, split gravity into parts: one down the ramp (causes sliding) and one into the ramp (affects normal force)."
  },
  {
    "concept": "Pulley Tension",
    "explanation": "If a pulley is massless and frictionless, tension stays constant throughout the rope. This simplifies Atwood machines."

    "concept": "Terminal Velocity",
    "explanation": "The speed at which drag force cancels out weight, so the object stops accelerating during free fall."
  },
  {
    "concept": "Drag Force",
    "explanation": "Drag opposes motion through a fluid like air or water, and it increases with speed."
  },
  {
    "concept": "Spring Equilibrium",
    "explanation": "When a spring hangs at rest, the upward spring force exactly balances the downward weight."
  },
  {
    "concept": "Spring Constant",
    "explanation": "The 'k' in Hooke’s Law. A stiffer spring has a higher k, meaning it takes more force to stretch or compress it."
  },
    
  {
    "concept": "Hooke’s Law",
    "explanation": "This law says spring force is proportional to how much it’s stretched or compressed. The formula is F = -kx. Negative sign = it pulls back toward equilibrium."
  },
  {
    "concept": "Restoring Force",
    "explanation": "Any force that brings a system back to equilibrium. In springs, it’s what pulls you back when you stretch it."
  },

    "concept": "Oscillation",
    "explanation": "Repeated motion back and forth around a center point. Could be a pendulum, spring, or any system with restoring force."
  },
  {
    "concept": "Period (T)",
    "explanation": "The time it takes to complete one full cycle. If a spring bounces up and down once every 2 seconds, that’s the period."
  },
  {
    "concept": "Frequency (f)",
    "explanation": "How many cycles happen per second. Measured in hertz. More bounces per second = higher frequency."
  },
  {
    "concept": "Amplitude",
    "explanation": "This is how far from equilibrium the motion goes. Bigger amplitude = more energy."
  },
  {
    "concept": "Centripetal Acceleration",
    "explanation": "Acceleration toward the center of a circular path. Always present in circular motion, even at constant speed."
  },
  {
    "concept": "Tangential Velocity",

  },
  {
    "concept": "Critical Speed",
    "explanation": "The minimum speed needed to stay on a curved path, like at the top of a roller coaster loop. Below it, you fall off."
  },
  {
    "concept": "Banked Curve",
    "explanation": "A sloped curve that lets you turn without needing friction. Think NASCAR or highway exits."
  },
  {
    "concept": "Non-Inertial Frame",
    "explanation": "A frame that’s accelerating. In these frames, objects *appear* to move without real forces acting on them."
  },
  {
    "concept": "Inertial Frame",
    "explanation": "A non-accelerating frame of reference. Newton’s laws only work without weird adjustments in these frames."
  },
  {
    "concept": "Relative Motion",
    "explanation": "Motion is measured based on your frame of reference. You can be still on a train but moving relative to the ground."
  },
  {
    "concept": "Vector Addition",

    "explanation": "Break a force at an angle into x and y parts. This makes writing equations way easier."
  },
  {
    "concept": "Uniform Circular Motion",
    "explanation": "Going in a circle at constant speed. Speed’s constant, but velocity (and acceleration) still change because of direction."
  },
  {
    "concept": "Non-Uniform Motion",
    "explanation": "When speed or direction (or both) change over time. Almost everything in the real world can be described this way."
  },
  {
    "concept": "Instantaneous Velocity",
    "explanation": "The velocity at one specific moment. Not an average—like checking your speedometer *right now*."
  },
  {
    "concept": "Average Acceleration",
    "explanation": "Change in velocity divided by time. It smooths out motion to give one clean value."
  },
  {
    "concept": "Uniform Acceleration",
    "explanation": "When acceleration doesn’t change over time. It’s the key condition for using the kinematic equations!"

    "explanation": "How far a projectile goes horizontally. Depends on launch angle, speed, and gravity."
  },
  {
    "concept": "Projectile Symmetry",
    "explanation": "Projectile motion is symmetric—time to rise = time to fall (if it starts and ends at the same height)."
  },
  {
    "concept": "Kinematic Equations",
    "explanation": "These equations describe motion with constant acceleration. Always start with what you know and pick the equation that fits."
  },
  {
    "concept": "Displacement vs Distance",
    "explanation": "Distance = total path. Displacement = net change in position. You can have big distance and zero displacement."
  },
  {
    "concept": "Work",
    "explanation": "Work is done when a force moves something through a distance. No movement = no work, even if you’re pushing hard!"
  },
  {
    "concept": "Work Formula",
    "explanation": "Work = Force × distance × cos(θ). The angle matters! Only the force in the direction of motion counts."
  },
  {
    "concept": "Positive vs Negative Work",
    "explanation": "If a force helps motion, work is positive. If it fights motion, work is negative. Think pushing vs resisting."
  },
  {
    "concept": "Power",
    "explanation": "Power is how fast work is done. More power = same work in less time. Measured in watts."
  },
  {
    "concept": "Conservation of Energy",
    "explanation": "Energy can’t be created or destroyed—just transferred or transformed. The total stays constant if no outside forces do work."
  },
  {
    "concept": "Mechanical Energy",

    "explanation": "Both momentum and kinetic energy are conserved. Think ideal bouncy ball or air hockey puck."
  },
  {
    "concept": "Inelastic Collision",
    "explanation": "Momentum is conserved, but kinetic energy isn’t. Some energy becomes heat, sound, etc."
  },
  {
    "concept": "Perfectly Inelastic Collision",

    "concept": "Center of Mass",
    "explanation": "The average location of mass in an object. It’s where you balance something if you want it to stay level."
  },
  {
    "concept": "Lever Arm",
    "explanation": "The distance from the pivot point to where the force is applied. Longer = more torque for the same force."
  },
  {
    "concept": "Rotational Inertia",
    "explanation": "This is like regular inertia, but for spinning. More mass, or mass farther from the axis = harder to spin."
  },
  
 
  {
    "concept": "Moment of Inertia",
    "explanation": "It’s like mass, but for rotation. Depends on how the mass is distributed around the axis."
  },
  {
    "concept": "Rolling Without Slipping",
    "explanation": "When a wheel rolls and the bottom point doesn’t slide. Velocity at the bottom = 0 at each moment."
  },
  {
    "concept": "Translational vs Rotational Motion",
    "explanation": "Translational = moving from one spot to another. Rotational = spinning. Objects can do both at once."
  },
  {
    "concept": "Center of Gravity",
    "explanation": "Basically the point where gravity ‘acts.’ For uniform objects, it’s the same as the center of mass."
  },
  {
    "concept": "Gravitational Field",
    "explanation": "This is gravity’s version of an electric field. It shows the strength and direction of gravitational force per unit mass."
  },
  {
    "concept": "Universal Law of Gravitation",
    "explanation": "Every mass pulls on every other mass. F = Gm₁m₂ / r². Yes, everything attracts everything—even you and Saturn."
  },
  {
    "concept": "Gravitational Potential Energy (Universal)",
    "explanation": "For big distances, like satellites, use U = -Gm₁m₂ / r instead of mgh."
  },
  {
    "concept": "Kepler’s Laws",
    "explanation": "Three laws describing orbits: planets move in ellipses, sweep equal areas in equal times, and orbital period² ∝ distance³."
  },
  {
    "concept": "Orbital Speed",
    "explanation": "Speed needed to stay in orbit. It balances gravity pulling inward with inertia moving forward."
  },
  {
    "concept": "Escape Velocity",
    "explanation": "Minimum speed to break free from gravity with no turning back. No more orbiting—you’re outta here."
  },
  {
    "concept": "Electric Force",
    "explanation": "It’s like gravity but for charges. Opposites attract, likes repel. Use Coulomb’s Law: F = kq₁q₂ / r²."
  },
  {
    "concept": "Coulomb’s Law",
    "explanation": "The electric force between charges depends on the product of charges and the square of the distance between them."
  },
  {
    "concept": "Electric Field Lines",
    "explanation": "They point away from positive and toward negative. More lines = stronger field."
  },
  {
    "concept": "Electric Potential",
    "explanation": "It’s the ‘electric energy per charge.’ Like gravitational potential, but for electric stuff. Measured in volts."
  },
  {
    "concept": "Equipotential Lines",
    "explanation": "Lines where electric potential is the same. Moving along one takes no work."
  },
  {
    "concept": "Capacitor",
    "explanation": "Stores electric energy by separating charges on two plates. More voltage = more stored charge."
  },
  {
    "concept": "Dielectric",
    "explanation": "An insulating material between capacitor plates that increases its ability to store charge."
  },
  {
    "concept": "Current Direction",
    "explanation": "Conventional current flows from positive to negative—even though electrons go the other way."
  },
  {
    "concept": "Kirchhoff’s Voltage Law",
    "explanation": "In any loop, the total voltage gained = total voltage dropped. Like energy budgeting for a circuit."
  },
  {
    "concept": "Kirchhoff’s Current Law",
    "explanation": "What flows into a junction = what flows out. Charge doesn’t just disappear."
  },
  {
    "concept": "Resistors in Series",
    "explanation": "Add them up: R_total = R₁ + R₂ + ... Current is the same through each."
  },
  {
    "concept": "Resistors in Parallel",
    "explanation": "Total resistance goes down. Use 1/R_total = 1/R₁ + 1/R₂ + ... Voltage is the same across each."
  },
  {
    "concept": "RC Circuit",
    "explanation": "A resistor and capacitor together. The capacitor charges gradually over time instead of instantly."
  },
  {
    "concept": "Magnetic Flux",
    "explanation": "Measures how much magnetic field goes through an area. Changing flux = induced current!"
