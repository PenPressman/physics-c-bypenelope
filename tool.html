  { "concept": "Rotational Inertia",
    "explanation": "Also called moment of inertia, it tells you how hard it is to spin something. More mass far from the axis = harder to spin."
  },
  {
    "concept": "Angular Momentum",
    "explanation": "It’s like momentum, but for spinning. Bigger radius or faster spin means more angular momentum—and it’s conserved unless a torque acts."
  },
  {
    "concept": "Doppler Effect",
    "explanation": "That high-pitch siren sound coming toward you? Lower when it passes? That’s Doppler."
  },
  {
    "concept": "Net Force",
    "explanation": "If all the forces on an object cancel out, the net force is zero—which means no acceleration. Don’t confuse movement with net force!"
  },
  {
    "concept": "Equilibrium",
    "explanation": "When the net force on an object is zero, it's in equilibrium. That includes constant velocity *or* staying still—basically no acceleration."
  },
  {
    "concept": "Newton’s First Law",
    "explanation": "An object will stay at rest or move in a straight line at constant speed unless something unbalanced pushes or pulls on it."
  },
  {
    "concept": "Inertia",

  },
  {
    "concept": "Field Force",
    "explanation": "Forces that act at a distance—like gravity, electric, or magnetic. They don’t need touching to work."
  },
  {
    "concept": "Newton’s Third Law",

    "concept": "Friction Direction",
    "explanation": "Friction always resists the direction of intended relative motion, not necessarily movement. It can actually point forward—like when you walk."
  },
  {
    "concept": "Coefficient of Friction",
    "explanation": "This is a value that tells you how grippy two surfaces are. Higher = more friction."
  },

  {
    "concept": "Inclined Plane Components",
    "explanation": "On a ramp, split gravity into parts: one down the ramp (causes sliding) and one into the ramp (affects normal force)."
  },
  {
    "concept": "Pulley Tension",
    "explanation": "If a pulley is massless and frictionless, tension stays constant throughout the rope. This simplifies Atwood machines."

  },
  {
    "concept": "Terminal Velocity",

    "explanation": "When a spring hangs at rest, the upward spring force exactly balances the downward weight."
  },
  {
    "concept": "Spring Constant",
    "explanation": "The 'k' in Hooke’s Law. A stiffer spring has a higher k, meaning it takes more force to stretch or compress it."
  },
    
  {
    "concept": "Hooke’s Law",
    "explanation": "This law says spring force is proportional to how much it’s stretched or compressed. The formula is F = -kx. Negative sign = it pulls back toward equilibrium."
  },
  {
    "concept": "Restoring Force",
    "explanation": "Any force that brings a system back to equilibrium. In springs, it’s what pulls you back when you stretch it."
  },

    "explanation": "How many cycles happen per second. Measured in hertz. More bounces per second = higher frequency."
  },
  {

  },
  {
    "concept": "Critical Speed",
    "explanation": "The minimum speed needed to stay on a curved path, like at the top of a roller coaster loop. Below it, you fall off."

    "explanation": "A frame that’s accelerating. In these frames, objects *appear* to move without real forces acting on them."
  },
  {
    "concept": "Inertial Frame",
    "explanation": "A non-accelerating frame of reference. Newton’s laws only work without weird adjustments in these frames."
  },
  {
    "concept": "Relative Motion",
    "explanation": "Motion is measured based on your frame of reference. You can be still on a train but moving relative to the ground."
  },
  {
    "concept": "Vector Addition",
    "explanation": "When combining forces or velocities, you need direction and magnitude. Use tip-to-tail or components."
  },
  {
    "concept": "Component Forces",
    "explanation": "Break a force at an angle into x and y parts. This makes writing equations way easier."
  },
  {
    "concept": "Uniform Circular Motion",
    "explanation": "Going in a circle at constant speed. Speed’s constant, but velocity (and acceleration) still change because of direction."
  },
  {
    "concept": "Non-Uniform Motion",
    "explanation": "When speed or direction (or both) change over time. Almost everything in the real world can be described this way."
  },
  {
    "concept": "Instantaneous Velocity",
    "explanation": "The velocity at one specific moment. Not an average—like checking your speedometer *right now*."
  },
  {
    "concept": "Average Acceleration",
    "explanation": "Change in velocity divided by time. It smooths out motion to give one clean value."
  },
  {
    "concept": "Uniform Acceleration",

    "explanation": "How far a projectile goes horizontally. Depends on launch angle, speed, and gravity."
  },
  {
    "concept": "Projectile Symmetry",
    "explanation": "Projectile motion is symmetric—time to rise = time to fall (if it starts and ends at the same height)."
  },
  {
    "concept": "Kinematic Equations",
    "explanation": "These equations describe motion with constant acceleration. Always start with what you know and pick the equation that fits."
  },
  {
    "concept": "Displacement vs Distance",
    "explanation": "Distance = total path. Displacement = net change in position. You can have big distance and zero displacement."
  },
 
  {
    "concept": "Work Formula",
    "explanation": "Work = Force × distance × cos(θ). The angle matters! Only the force in the direction of motion counts."
  },
  {
    "concept": "Positive vs Negative Work",
    "explanation": "If a force helps motion, work is positive. If it fights motion, work is negative. Think pushing vs resisting."
  },
 
  
  {
    "concept": "Mechanical Energy",
    "explanation": "This is the sum of kinetic and potential energy. It stays constant in ideal systems (no friction or outside work)."
  },
  {
    "concept": "Gravitational Potential Energy",
    "explanation": "Energy stored based on height. More height = more potential to fall and gain speed."

  },
  {
    "concept": "Perfectly Inelastic Collision",

  },
 
  {
    "concept": "Impulse-Momentum Theorem",
