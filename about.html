      <div class="about-content">
        <p>Welcome to Phys by Pen, I'm Penelope. I started making this website as a way for me to study and help other study, and then it expanded. I wanted to start including games and visuals etc to get more people excited about learning physics, so you'll notice more of those appearing over time. If all continues as planned, this site will continue to grow and include more and more! So far (updated: summer '24) we've had over 200 readers, and I'm excited to reach others. </p>
       <h2 class="about-header">So what does this site cover?</h2>
        <p>I've taken intro physics courses, as well as AP Physics C, so that is the main content so far. I focus on expanations rather than practice problems (you can find those all over the place), but see what works for you. If you're taking a more introductory physics course, ignore what doesn't seem to be relevant to your class and any calculus based stuff if that is not applicable. As for the games, those are to practice specific basic concepts just to get the hang of them -- they are works in progress! Soon, when I finish my current course, I'll update the site with thermodynamics content (as well as *hopfully* optics and statistical mechanics). Feel free to contact me for any clarification. You can also find sources I learned from and lots of helpful references on the source page!</p>

        <p>Stay tuned for more content, feel free to explore, learn, and have fun!</p>
