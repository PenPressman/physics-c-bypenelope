      <div class="about-content">
        <p>Welcome to Phys by Pen, I'm Penelope. I started making this website as a way for me to study and help others study, and then it expanded. I began including games and visuals etc. to get more people excited about learning physics, so you'll notice more of those appearing over time.</p>
       <h2 class="about-header">So what does this site cover?</h2>
        <p>I've taken courses on intro physics, AP Physics C, Thermodynamics, Optics, Special Relativity, and Quantum Mechanics. This site most comprehensively covers AP Physics C, since I've spent more time thinking about it and building my understanding. I focus on expanations rather than practice problems (you can find those all over the place), but see what works for you. If you're taking an introductory physics course, ignore what doesn't seem to be relevant to your class and any calculus based stuff if that is not applicable. As for the games, those are to practice specific basic concepts just to get the hang of them -- they are works in progress. I'm currently updating the site with content from the latter subjects I mentioned, but since more students at my school have begun using this resource, I'm also adding stuff to the AP units. You can find the sources I learned from and other references on the source page.</p>

        <p>Stay tuned for more content, feel free to explore, learn, and have fun! Please reach out with any questions or request. I only know a small fraction of the field of pysics, but I'll try to look into anything or at least find more resources for you.</p>
