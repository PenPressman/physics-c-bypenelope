<p class="formatted-paragraph" </u> The main thing I’ll start with for this unit is a quick note: rely on  your conservation statements! If something isn’t adding up, check your work. And I mean “adding up” literally; specifically, your conservation of energy and momentum statements should add up equally on the “before” and “after” sides. And, since a lot of this unit involves relationships between variables, I find it helpful to check the units of what you are multiplying to confirm the units of your result. Oh, and sign convention gets weird because there are a lot of scalars here, but I’ll explain that for each concept below. Have fun! </p>

    <h2 style="text-align: center;">Center of Mass</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">
(As per usual, I’m starting with what I think of as the most isolated concept of this unit.)<br><br>
You know how up until now, when we talk about the motion of random objects like cars or people or blocks, everything of the same mass kind of acts the same regardless of its shape? Well, it's easier to solve problems when we simplify that way, but in the real world objects are more complex. Objects have weird angles, different shapes, and, ready for it? Centers of mass! As the name suggests, the center of mass is the point at which all surrounding mass is equally distributed. When we think of things like gravity acting on an object, we actually calculate how it's acting on the objects <u>center of mass</u>. So, here’s what you need to know: <br> <br>

1. We can calculate the center of mass of a system algebraically or using calculus based on what we know about the object/its composition. For these calculations, see the formula sheet.<br>
2. Always calculate the components of an object COM separately (x, y, z).<br>
3. Sometimes we get lucky, and can use symmetry to find COM! For example, you know where the COM of a rectangle is (the midpoint vertically and horizontally). <br>
4. For AP purposes, make sure to memorize derivations for common COM scenarios (ie rods, circles, triangles).
    
<br><br>


    <h2 style="text-align: center;">Energy</h2>

<p style="text-align: left;">
TLDR: the energy on the “before” side of a conservation of energy (COE) equation ALWAYS needs to be the same as the energy “after.” Did potential energy decrease? Well then, something else must have increased <br><br>
It's hard to get into what energy is within a brief overview or intro course, but as you've probably heard, it is conserved within a closed system (not created nor destroyed). So, problems pertaining to energy will have to do with what <u>kind</u> of energy the system begins and ends with.<br><br>If you don’t overthink it, conservation of energy is pretty simple, there are just a few kinds of energy we have to deal with (and the formulas are on the formula page):
<h4 style="text-align: center;"> <u>The Types of Energy (or, the basic kinds)</u> </h4>
<p style="text-align: left;">
1. Kinetic, the energy of movement (all moving objects have some). <br>
2. Potential, either from gravity or something like a spring (I think of this as energy waiting to be turned kinetic, like when you almost drop a ball and it was juuust about to fall through the air if you let go).<br>
3. What I call “loseable energy,” aka “Q,” from stuff like friction.
<br>
<h4 style="text-align: center;"> <u>Solving COE Problems</u></h4>
<p style="text-align: left;">
I have exciting news, you now have a new option for solving a bunch of problems that previously required kinematics! After you learn this, you'll realize its much easier than kinematics for many simple sitations. For example, if you are trying to figure out how fast a ball is moving after falling down 10 meters, you can calculate how much potential energy it lost to figure out how much kinetic energy it must have gained (ie, the "h" in the forumula decreases, which means something in the formula for kinetic energy must have increased, and since mass and 1/2 are constant, that must be v, aka velocity!). This is another “need to do practice problems” situation, but basically just follow these steps:

<br>
1. Add up the energy a system had “before” and put that on the left side of an equation.<br>
2. Add up all the energy a system has “after” and put that on the right side of the equation (so, equal to the left side).<br>
3. Solve for missing pieces. <br>

<h4 style="text-align: center;"> <u>Collisions (Energy Perspective)</u></h4>
<p style="text-align: left;">
There are two types of collisions: elastic and inelastic. Elastic means that kinetic energy is conserved (so basically the objects bounce back). Inelastic means the objects lose kinetic energy, and fully inelastic means they stick together (think pieces of clay hitting each other and then continuing to move but now as one big glob). While you could figure problems out without memorizing the formula, I recommend memorizing the one I noted for elastic collisions.


<br>
<p style="text-align: left;">
One last note, the “height” in your gravitational potential calculation is not absolute, you just need to make sure that if gravitational potential changes, you are being accurate about the change in “h.” So, if a ball moves from 20m in the air to 10m, you could set 20m as 10m and 10 as 0m and still get everything right.

<br>
<br>
 <h2 style="text-align: center;">Work and Power</h2>
    <p style="text-align: left;">

To be honest, my strategy to learn this was to memorize the formulas and then make sure I know what each term meant. But i’ll say this: be careful with your relationships between variables, don’t derive something instead of integrating! Other than that, just keep in mind these definitions:<br><br>

    <p style="text-align: left;">
<u>Work</u> is the transfer of energy by a force, and it is a SCALAR. (so, positive if it's transferring energy <u>in</u> vs negative if out, so the sign has NOTHING TO DO WITH DIRECTION. Keep in mind, for work to be done by a force, the force must be parallel to the resulting displacement. Work is also equal to the change in K (formula on formula page).<br>
<u>Power</u> is the rate of work done with respect to time, and it is a SCALAR. Oh and remember the rate part, because it’ll help you with units (one J is equal to 1 Ns). <br>
<br>
The main thing here is remembering that since these quantities are scalar, “how much work” a force does has no involvement with direction (other than the parallel thing). So, if I push a box forwards 10m and then backwards 10m, F<sub>applied by me</sub> is the same as if I push the box 20m forwards.

  
 <h2 style="text-align: center;">Momentum and Impulse</h2>

    <p style="text-align: left;">
In terms of how we use this in basic problems (basically anything ≤ to AP Physics C), COP looks a lot like COE. Since momentum is just a description of the overall mass and velocity of the system (obtained by multiplying those quantities for each object), you can think of the p of a system as just moving around from object to object. Remember how, for COE, when kinetic energy in a system increases, something else, like potential energy, decreases? In this case, you'll mostly see examples where when the momentum of one object increases, the momentum of the other decreases. The actual equation you set up is similar to COE, just make sure the totals are equal on both sides! Also, momentum is important because in physics, at a certain point, it'll increasingly be the case that you'll use momentum instead of velocity. Momentum just carries more info in a simpler way (ie velocity, which includes direction, and mass). Knowing the momentum of an object or system tells you quite a bit about it! Fun fact (thought this complicates our assumption that if an object's mass is 0, so is it's momentum, so ignore this if that will bother you and you just want to get through high-school physics): light is massless, so we calculate the momentum of photons (which make up light) by equating E = pc (where E is energy, c is the speed of light, and p--as usual--is momentum). You may be thinking, then can't we use light to move stuff, since photons hitting other objects could transfer momentum? I suggest you google the concept of solar sails. They are AWESOME (theoretically).  

<h4 style="text-align: center;"> <u>Collisions (Momentum Perspective)</u></h4>
<p style="text-align: left;"><br>
Ok the main thing to note here is that if you have a perfectly inelastic collision (as explained above), then the right side of the equation will combine multiple masses into one, because the objects will now move at the same speed.<br>
For elastic equations, either solve them when you see them or memorize the formula I included. For me, it was good practice to derive the formula by combining a COP and COE statement (try it, it works).
