<p class="formatted-paragraph" </u> This unit is… a lot. If it is easier to break this up into simple harmonic motion and gravity as <u>separate units</u>, feel free to do so, but there is some overlap that can be interesting and helpful conceptually. Luckily, we can still rely on previous units for background knowledge that will make things much easier to learn and figure out. Even though the AP gives you formulas for some stuff, I recommend using the tricks I include (some of which are from my class/textbooks and some of which I made), or your own, in order to memorize what you can. It’ll help you get through problems faster if you start to associate relevant formulas with the concepts they go with (and there are <u>a lot</u> on the AP so this will save you from having to read through them)! <br>

<p style="text-align: left;">
It will be easier to learn all of this through examples, but before we start: simple harmonic motion (SHM) refers to periodic motion due to a consistent restoring force. In an SHM scenario, we’ll have an equilibrium point in the middle of the period (the time it takes to complete a cycle). Think of the period as the time one oscillation takes; meaning, frequency will give you a value in a new unit: hz, for how many oscillations the system experiences in an amount of time. I’ll go into more detail about how the rest of the formulas work in each example, but for me it has been helpful to think of things broadly first. Also, in this unit there will often be multiple viable ways to solve things given the many relationships between variables, so figure out what comes easiest to you, or what makes the most sense (though hopefully, eventually, everything will!). </p><br>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">Mass Springs</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">
The basics of mass-spring systems have come up already in the forces unit, so now instead of describing what springs <u>do</u>, we’re just focusing on <u>how they move</u>, and what those cycles look like. Picture a spring with a mass on the end, oscillating up and down. That’s what we’re learning about here.  <br><br> If you want a good intro to this unit, play around with a string and different masses for a bit. <br><br> Remember, we also already learned how to solve for systems with multiple springs, so make sure you know series vs parallel spring calculations. <br><br> Ok, the main part: the reason we have the relationships between 2π, ω, f and T (which you can see on the formula page), is that you can think of a mass on a spring (or any simple harmonic motion, for that matter) as an imaginary particle moving in a circle, except in reality, the circle is just a back-and-forth path. This is why, when we calculate the position or speed of the mass in examples, we use sin/cos functions to help us account for the periodic-ness of the function. Granted, this is not the technical way of explaining all of this, and it's mostly just based on how I understand it, but going over these concepts a few times is helpful, because SHM has many consistent patterns across different scenarios. Another thing to note is that instead of memorizing where along the “graph” of a mass-spring system’s motion the kinetic energy or spring-potential energy will be highest, you can just think through it. If a spring is being held and not allowed to expand with a mass on its end, it clearly has potential energy given that it could at any moment be released and cause movement, and you can also tell that it doesn’t currently have kinetic energy since it is not moving. Oh make sure to remember, if the spring system is vertical, there might also be gravitational potential, and if there is a surface involved in a scenario, there could be friction! On things like practice APs, most questions I’ve seen test your understanding of the relationships between variables in spring systems, so like: when is it moving fastest, which system has a greater period, etc. Make sure you know everything well enough to be ready for those. </p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;"> Pendulums </h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">
Before we get into any specifics of pendulums (which, if you don’t know, are systems where there is mass swinging freely from a fixed point; so, picture one of those metronome things swinging back and forth in a grandfather clock), here are a few things to keep in mind: </p><br>
<p style="text-align: left;">
1. When finding the height of the mass, you can use L-Lcosθ, where “L” is distance between the fixed point and mass at its equilibrium point at the base of the pendulum and θ is the angle the mass has swung through. <br>
2. Remember that in most problems air resistance can be neglected; however, it could be a good time to remind yourself of how drag would affect any given scenario (even if simply conceptually rather than mathematically)!<br>
3. Just like any SHM example, consider the relationships between potential energy (this time it’s gravitational!) and kinetic energy, and think through how that would impact the velocity. Remember, K=1/2mv<sup>2</sup>... <br>
</p>


<h4 style="text-align: center;"><u>Simple Pendulums</u></h4>
<p style="text-align: left;">
This is the one you pictured earlier, fixed top point, swinging back and forth. Besides memorizing the formula on the sheet, you can also derive it from first principles, aka f=ma, by relating the force of gravity to mass and the 2nd derivative of the position, which in this case will be angular displacement. Remember, once you get to a place with a formula that looks similar to the hallmark of SHM, use that similarity to find what ω will be in that scenario. <br><br> Next, the only other thing you need to know for these is that for angles less than 15 degrees, we just make sinθ equal to θ. Don’t ask me why… we just do. The good news is, it makes things simpler, the bad news is, if you’re like me, it might be endlessly frustrating knowing you're a bit further from an accurate calculation than you could be. But anyway… moving on!!</p>
<br>
<h4 style="text-align: center;"><u>Physical Pendulums</u></h4>
<p style="text-align: left;">
For these, picture one upright ruler (perfectly vertical), and then a second ruler overlapping at a slight angle with the first one. Then imagine a nail is put loosely through the rulers, so that the angled one begins to swing back and forth while the vertical one stays upright. If this example doesn’t make sense to you, google a physical pendulum: personally I like to think of this version. This time, we can derive ω  from the net torque equation, which is basically just a spin-off from f=ma. The main thing to keep in mind is being careful with any distance variables: make sure you know which refers to the length of the pendulum, the COM, the axis of rotation, and any values between those. Ok, all set! </p><br>

<h4 style="text-align: center;"><u>Torsion Pendulums</u></h4>
<p style="text-align: left;">
I’m not going to try relating this to anything real-world because I can’t personally think of a time I have seen these, but other than googling an image: think of a spring that twists (or spirals) downward, and then when it’s coiled up enough, “unsprings” the other way. This repeats again, giving us our SHM scenario. Ok from there: don’t derive this one, you need a “torsion constant” which will be given. Then, use the formula and you’re set!  </p><br>

<h2 style="text-align: center;"> Gravity </h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">
Writing </p>

<h4 style="text-align: center;"><u>g-fields</u></h4>
<p style="text-align: left;">
Quickly, remember that the g-fields we’re talking about refer to a situation in which a mass/object feels a force and thus experiences acceleration due to gravity, caused by a large mass it is near (ususally earth/another planet). <br><br>
The first thing I recommenddoing is separating your view of g-fields into those outside planets and those inside. Before you even start thinking about the formulas, this will help you remember not to just find a way to plug in a fraction of r or anything like that for the radial value. We’re already familiar with the outside part, which you have already seen in the form of g=-9.8 at/near the surface of earth. To derive a simple formula, we can use what we know about F<sub>g</sub>, in that it is equal to both mg and a times the general g formula (see formula page), then cancel m to find a value for g. For the inside version, we can use density to solve for g in terms of the radius the second mass is at. Using the relationship between density, mass, and volume, we can get the mass of the larger object (earth/a planet) in terms of the changing radius, and then plug that back into our general g equation and cancel repetitive variables to find g<sub>ins</sub>.<br><br>

Once we know all this, we can connect back to SHM by noting that whenever you have a force equaling a constant times a changing distance variable (“r” in this case), things start to look really similar to f<sub>s</sub>=kx, and we can employ the tools of SHM! Try practicing finding “K<sub>grav</sub>” aka the gravitational constant, and using that to find the period of a theoretical basketball being dropped… through the earth. Given that we now it’s harmonic, and the fact that we can use the formulas for g-ins and g-outs to see how the force will change as the basketball drops, we’ll be able to conclude that, given a starting drop, the ball would fall through the center of the earth, pause at the other end and turn around, and repeat back and forth forever. Yes, this relies on the assumption we could remove all other variables and drill a basketball-sized hole in the entirety of the earth, but still, it’s fun. </p><br>

<h4 style="text-align: center;"><u>Gravitational Potential Energy (new unit perspective)</u></h4>
<p style="text-align: left;">
There’s really just one change we’re making from our previous conception of gravitational potential energy (remember, we set it equal to mgh after integrating mg from 0 to a height “h”). Now that we know how to find “g” when it is far enough from earth’s shell to not always have a magnitude of 9.8, we can change the limits of integration to be infinity to r, and plug in our new formula for g. Practice this and check the formula sheet to make sure you got it right, but now we have a new U<sub>g</u> formula that we can use for wayyy more “heights.”   </p><br>

<h4 style="text-align: center;"><u>Escape Velocity</u></h4>
<p style="text-align: left;">
Now that we now how hard objects get pulled into earth, we need a way to calculate how fast they need to move to break free of that force (*that explanation is not at all in technical terms but that’s how I think of it*). This is called: escape velocity! <br><br>We know that since we want to escape the pull, we need to reach where U<sub>g</sub> = 0. And, since we want to find the threshold for this, not just some speed that is more than enough, we want K to equal 0 as well. This means we’ll use up allll our energy breaking free, and will be successful with no extra energy to spare. That was repetitive because once you know this, the math part is easy to solve. Set up a COE equation with both K and U<sub>g</sub> on both sides, except on the right (the “after”), those values will both be 0. Then, solve for v<sub>initial</sub> and there’s your escape velocity! Or, do this derivation generally and use the formula to find v<sub>c</sub> super quickly every time. By the way, the formula looks really similar to one of the orbital formulas, which we’ll see in a min, so deriving this one once will help you keep track  of which is which. *Hint, only this one has a 2!

<br></p>


<h2 style="text-align: center;"> Kepler’s Laws </h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">
Kepler’s laws are experimentally proven rules that help us understand how planets move. <br>
There are three laws, <u>memorize them</u> and their implications:<br>
<p style="text-align: center;">1</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">
<em>All planets move in elliptical orbits with the sun at one focus.</em> (And objects orbit planets in the same way.)If you need a reminder of what an ellipse looks like, look at the image at the top of this page: note, the speed of the moving sphere is inaccurate for simplification, and after reading these laws you’ll know why! </p><br>

<p style="text-align: center;">2</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">

<em>Planets sweep across equal area in equal time</em>. <br>
When a planet is closer to a focus near the side of an ellipse, since there is less distance between the planet and the focus, we know it will move faster. When the planet is moving on the other side, farther from the focus, it will be moving slower but have more area covered given the increased distance. Overall, there will be even area swept over in even time. This also confirmed conservation of angular momentum, since we know that change in angular position over change in time is equal to ω, and thus Iω will be constant (L=Iω).
</p><br>

<p style="text-align: center;">3</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">
The third law gives us the formulas that relate orbital period to orbital radius (see formula sheet). Importantly, there are two formulas for two kinds of orbits: elliptical and circular. Remember that for elliptical orbits, the orbital radius gets swapped for half the value of the semi-major axis (aka the length of the ellipse at its farthest points). Speaking of orbits…

</p><br>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">Orbits</h2>

If you’re not reading this page in order, go back and learn Kepler’s laws before you read this part. <br>

<h4 style="text-align: center;"><u>Switching Orbits</u></h4>
<p style="text-align: left;">
Now that we have an understanding about the way objects orbit planets, or planets orbit the sun, we know that in order to move to a circular orbit rather than an eliptical one, the “orbiter” needs to move at a certain speed. This is the formula that looks similar to v<sub>escape</sub> so keep track of which is which! A circular orbit will require this velocity to be constant, and each orbit will have a different velocity given that the radius changes it. What do you think of when you think of a change in velocity from one time to another, knowing we have just said it's “constant” so there’s no acceleration? Kinetic energy? Maybe that was not your first thought, but that’s what comes up next. <br>
<br>

We can use the velocity values to find K values, and once we have those, we can find things like net work! Also, since we know that angular momentum is conserved in orbits, we can also use COL equations to find missing velocity values, knowing that the circular ones are easy to find with our formula. So, do some practice and you’re done!
