<p class="formatted-paragraph"> In a nutshell, Newton’s laws let us describe and analyze motion. We can derive lots of other stuff from these “first principles.” Also, as you enter this unit, remember not to make any assumptions about what is causing an object to move. I remember this as <b> <u> "there's a source for every force," </b> </u> meaning, if, for example, there is ball hanging from a string, and the string is attached to a moving plane, the string is the only thing pulling the ball up, not the plane. This will all make sense later, but I like to start by thinking about it.</p>

        <p> For this unit, just keep in mind what I wrote above: you CANNOT just assume there is a force because there is MOVEMENT. Rather, a force indicates a change in ACCELERATION. Another thing to keep in mind is that if an object is moving at a constant speed, or is at rest, then the net force acting on it MUST BE 0. If, for example, an object is sitting at rest on a table, and we know that gravity is exerting a force “Fg” (which, given F=ma, will be equal to the object's mass x 9.8m/s), then in order for the object to not accelerate downward, it must be experiencing an upward force equal to Fg in magnitude but opposite in direction (this is where Newton’s 3rd law comes in!). We call this the “normal force,” F<sub>N</sub>. This example is the simplest “third law pair” scenario I can think of, and it’s important to keep in mind that the reason Newton’s laws are so helpful is because they really do always work if applied correctly. So, when you’re working on force problems, remember the pairs!<br> <br><br> Another thing to keep in mind is <u> always draw free body diagrams</u>, even if you are not explicitly told to. They will help you keep in mind what the scenario looks like, and are super important when things get more complicated (ex. Atwood machines, or you need to draw components (ex. Inclined planes). <br><br>I’m not going to go over the specifics of drawing them because again, practice is key, but basically, each force gets an arrow, the length of which represents its magnitude relative to other forces acting on the object. I reccomend using solid lines for overall forces and then dotted lines to separate horizontal and vertical components.</p>

    <h2 style="text-align: center;">Friction and Drag</h2>
<style>
    /* Style for the header */
    h1 {
        text-shadow: 2px 2px 4px navy; /* Add a navy shadow to the text */
    }
</style>
<p style="text-align: left;">
       Before we talk about anything with friction, I want to make one thing super clear, because I used to get really confused about it. Contrary to what you may have heard or thought, <u> friction does NOT necessarily oppose movement</u>, instead, friction is defined as a force opposing <u>inteded</u> motion. For example, when you are walking, friction is actually pointing in the same direction you are moving. In fact, it is the force moving you forward!<br><br>
Ok, taking a step back, there are two kinds of friction, both listed here: </p>
<p style="text-align: center;">
1. Static Friction (f<sub>s</sub>)<br>
2. Kinetic Friction (f<sub>k</sub>)</p><br>
<p style="text-align: left;">
Friction is “static” when it pertains to multiple unmoving objects,though there must be a force trying to move one, or there would be no “intended motion” to oppose. and kinetic when those objects are moving against each other. Friction is “kinetic” once those objects are moving against each other.
<br><br>
For me, it hasn’t worked well when I try to “common sense” my way through applications of friction. While this may not be the case for everyone, I find the directions of friction kinda counterintuitive, so I just write everything out without making any assumptions, and go from there. For example, if given a scenario where a car is moving foreward, I don’t just assume friction is backwards, and I wait to set up net force equations and see what happens (more on that when we talk about rolling/slipping).
<br><br>
Ok I almost forgot about drag, oops:
<br><br>
Basically, drag resists movement when an object traveles through a non-solid material (so, a liquid or gas). The most common examples you’ll see are probably something falling through water, air, or snow. If you know there few things, you’re good to go:
<br>
<p style="text-align: center;">

<br>

1. As velocity increase, so does drag (because, as seen on my formula page, drag = -kv (where v is velocity and k is a constant related to the material the object is moving through, technically it’s surface area but I don’t like thinking of it like that so idk up to you).<br><br>
2. Drag acts in the opposite direction of velocity.

<p style="text-align: left;">
<br>
Now you see why the kinematics problems say “neglect air resistance” so that you have constant acceleration from gravity only.
<br> 
Ready for a quiz? If my velocity goes from 2m/s to 10m/s (while I fly through the air, because I just learned to fly), what is the ratio of the drag I was experiencing initially to the drag I’m experiencing now? Did you say 1:5? Yes? Yayyy, correct!<br><br>
Lastly, we use drag to figure out terminal velocity, which you can see on the formula page! (We can also derive v(t) as an object experiencing a drag force, which is cool too).

    <h2 style="text-align: center;">Springs</h2>
<style>
    /* Style for the header */
    h1 {
        text-shadow: 2px 2px 4px navy; /* Add a navy shadow to the text */
    }
</style>
<p style="text-align: left;">
      To start, “Hooke’s Law” says that the force of a spring F<sub>S</sub> is equal and opposite to the amount an object has been displaced from its equilibrium point (at which it will hang without accelerating)times the spring constant. You can view the formula version on the formula page.
 <br> if you have multiple springs attached to one object (“in parallel” with each other), the overall spring constant (K<sub>equivalent</sub>) can be found using this formula:
<br>
<p style="text-align: center;">
1/K<sub>1</sub> + 11/K<sub>2</sub> = 1/K<sub>equivalent</sub>
<br><p style="text-align: left;">

<p style="text-align: left;">
<br> If the springs are attached in a line, with one end at the start of the other (“in series” with each other), you can just add the spring constants to find the equivalent constant.
<br>
<br>
**fun fact, this is also how we find equivalent capacitance for capacitor in series/paralell later on in electrostatics!
<br>
<br>
As for applications of springs, I think it’s easiest to just give you info on the most common scenarios, in a list:
<br>
<br>
1. To find equilibrium for an object hanging from a spring, find where the magnitude of the spring force equals the magnitude of the force of gravity (though they are in opposite directions, of course). <br> <br>
2. When a problem gives you the length of a spring hanging at rest, that is its equilibrium length. “X” in your formula is how far from equilibrium the spring is stretched/compressed. <br> <br>
2. Don’t worry about the period of springs yet, that is unit 5. <br><br>


 <h2 style="text-align: center;">Inclined Planes</h2>
<style>
    /* Style for the header */
    h1 {
        text-shadow: 2px 2px 4px navy; /* Add a navy shadow to the text */
    }
</style>
    <p style="text-align: left;">
    First of all, components, components, components, components. That’s what you should think when you see an inclined plane. Remember that, for example, F<sub>g</sub> is only equal to the vertical component of the normal force, not the horizontal part. And, you need to draw the normal force perpendicular to the inclined plane just as you would draw it perpendicular to a flat surface by drawing a line straight up.<br>

<style>
    /* Style for the header */
    h1 {
        text-shadow: 2px 2px 4px navy; /* Add a navy shadow to the text */
    }
</style>
 <p style="text-align: left;"> The two most common scenarios I see for elevator problems are: <br> <br> 1. Person standing in an elevator; in this case, the only two forces are F<sub>N</sub> up and F<sub>g</sub> down. <br> <br> 2. Something hanging from a string in the elevator; in this case, the only forces are the force of tension from the string up(F<sub>T</sub>) and F<sub>g</sub> down. DO NOT try to rationalize finding some sort of “force of elevator,” that is not a thing. The elevator part comes in when we use Newton’s 3rd law, because the acceleration will change if the elevator is accelerating, and since g is constant here, (F<sub>T</sub>)must be the thing changing.
