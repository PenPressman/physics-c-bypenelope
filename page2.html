<p class="formatted-paragraph" </u> To start this unit, read what’s in the ovals above ^^ In a nutshell, Newton’s laws let us describe and analyze motion. We can derive lots of other stuff from these “first principles.” Also, as you enter this unit, remember not to make any assumptions about what is causing an object to move. I remember this as </u> <u>"there's a source for every force,"</u> meaning, if, for example, there is a ball hanging from a string, and the string is attached to a moving plane, the string is the only thing pulling the ball up, not the plane. This will all make sense later, but I like to start by thinking about it.<br>

    <div style="text-align: left;">
        <p> For this unit, just keep in mind what I wrote above: you CANNOT just assume there is a force because there is MOVEMENT. Rather, a force indicates a change in ACCELERATION. Another thing to keep in mind is that if an object is moving at a constant speed, or is at rest, then the net force acting on it MUST BE 0. If, for example, an object is sitting at rest on a table, and we know that gravity is exerting a force “F<sub>g</sub>” (which, given F=ma, will be equal to the object's mass x 9.8m/s), then in order for the object to not accelerate downward, it must be experiencing an upward force equal to Fg in magnitude but opposite in direction (this is where Newton’s 3rd law comes in!). We call this the “normal force,” F<sub>N</sub>. This example is the simplest “third law pair” scenario I can think of, and it’s important to keep in mind that the reason Newton’s laws are so helpful is because they really do always work if applied correctly. So, when you’re working on force problems, remember the pairs!<br> <br><br> Another thing to keep in mind is <u> always draw free body diagrams</u>, even if you are not explicitly told to. They will help you keep in mind what the scenario looks like, and are super important when things get more complicated (ex. Atwood machines, or you need to draw components (ex. Inclined planes). <br><br>I’m not going to go over the specifics of drawing them because again, practice is key, but basically, each force gets an arrow, the length of which represents its magnitude relative to other forces acting on the object. I reccomend using solid lines for overall forces and then dotted lines to separate horizontal and vertical components.</p>

    <h2 style="text-align: center;">Friction and Drag</h2>
<style>
    /* Style for the header */
    h1 {
        text-shadow: 2px 2px 4px navy; /* Add a navy shadow to the text */
    }
</style>
    <h4 style="text-align: center;"> <u>Friction</u></h4>
<p style="text-align: left;">
       Before we talk about anything with friction, I want to make one thing super clear, because I used to get really confused about it. Contrary to what you may have heard or thought, <u> friction does NOT necessarily oppose movement</u>, instead, friction is defined as a force opposing <u>inteded</u> motion. For example, when you are walking, friction is actually pointing in the same direction you are moving. In fact, it is the force moving you forward!<br><br>
Ok, taking a step back, there are two kinds of friction, both listed here: </p>
<p style="text-align: center;">
1. Static Friction (f<sub>s</sub>)<br>
2. Kinetic Friction (f<sub>k</sub>)</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">
Friction is “static” when it pertains to multiple unmoving objects,though there must be a force trying to move one, or there would be no “intended motion” to oppose. and kinetic when those objects are moving against each other. Friction is “kinetic” once those objects are moving against each other. Friction goes from static to kinetic when the force reaches (f<sub>s-max</sub>), which you can see the formula for on the formula page above.
<br><br>
For me, it hasn’t worked well when I try to “common sense” my way through applications of friction. While this may not be the case for everyone, I find the directions of friction kinda counterintuitive, so I just write everything out without making any assumptions, and go from there. For example, if given a scenario where a car is moving forward, I don’t just assume friction is backwards, and I wait to set up net force equations and see what happens (more on that when we talk about rolling/slipping).
<br>
Last note, as you can see on the formula sheet, the force of friction is equal to an object's normal force * the coefficient of friction between what it and what it is trying to move against, which is a constant that differs for every combination of surfaces.
<br><br>
      <h4 style="text-align: center;"> <u>Drag</u></h4>
Ok I almost forgot about drag, oops:
<br><br>
Basically, drag resists movement when an object traveles through a non-solid material (so, a liquid or gas). The most common examples you’ll see are probably something falling through water, air, or snow. If you know there few things, you’re good to go:
<br>
<p style="text-align: center;">

<br>

1. As velocity increase, so does drag (because, as seen on my formula page, drag = -kv (where v is velocity and k is a constant related to the material the object is moving through, technically it’s surface area but I don’t like thinking of it like that so idk up to you).<br><br>
2. Drag acts in the opposite direction of velocity.

<p style="text-align: left;">
<br>
Now you see why the kinematics problems say “neglect air resistance” so that you have constant acceleration from gravity only.
<br> 
Ready for a quiz? If my velocity goes from 2m/s to 10m/s (while I fly through the air, because I just learned to fly), what is the ratio of the drag I was experiencing initially to the drag I’m experiencing now? Did you say 1:5? Yes? Yayyy, correct!<br><br>
Lastly, we use drag to figure out terminal velocity, which you can see on the formula page! (We can also derive v(t) as an object experiencing a drag force, which is cool too).

    <h2 style="text-align: center;">Springs</h2>
<style>
    /* Style for the header */
    h2 {
        text-shadow: 2px 2px 4px navy; /* Add a navy shadow to the text */
    }
</style>
<p style="text-align: left;">
      To start, “Hooke’s Law” says that the force of a spring F<sub>S</sub> is equal and opposite to the amount an object has been displaced from its equilibrium point (at which it will hang without accelerating)times the spring constant. You can view the formula version on the formula page.
 <br> if you have multiple springs attached to one object (“in parallel” with each other), the overall spring constant (K<sub>equivalent</sub>) can be found using this formula:
<br>
<p style="text-align: center;">
1/K<sub>1</sub> + 11/K<sub>2</sub> = 1/K<sub>equivalent</sub>
<br><p style="text-align: left;">

<p style="text-align: left;">
<br> If the springs are attached in a line, with one end at the start of the other (“in series” with each other), you can just add the spring constants to find the equivalent constant.
<br>
<br>
**fun fact, this is also how we find equivalent capacitance for capacitor in series/paralell later on in electrostatics!
<br>
<br>
As for applications of springs, I think it’s easiest to just give you info on the most common scenarios, in a list:
<br>
<br>
1. To find equilibrium for an object hanging from a spring, find where the magnitude of the spring force equals the magnitude of the force of gravity (though they are in opposite directions, of course). <br> <br>
2. When a problem gives you the length of a spring hanging at rest, that is its equilibrium length. “X” in your formula is how far from equilibrium the spring is stretched/compressed. <br> <br>
2. Don’t worry about the period of springs yet, that is unit 5. <br><br>


 <h2 style="text-align: center;">Circular Motion</h2>
    <p style="text-align: left;">
    The first thing to note about circular motion is that <u>this will come up later</u>! You’ll see the formula again a bunch, including in E & M when you look at the paths particles take.<br> <br>
Here are the main things to note about circular motion: <br> <br>
1. When an object is moving in a circle, it has acceleration pointed inward along the u>radial line</u>. That means a key thing to note is that even if you’re given a problem where a car is moving in a circle at a constant speed (i.e. the magnitude of its velocity is not changing), it can still have acceleration, and in fact, it does! Because the object is changing direction, and velocity is a vector, objects moving in circles experience <u>centripital acceleration</u>. Because of Newton’s 3rd law, we know that this acceleration must be caused by a force, which we’ll call <u>centripital force</u>, (F<sub>c</sub>). Remember this when setting up net-force equations! Don’t get tricked by scenarios like this on the AP… <br> Quick quiz: if a bird is flying around a tree at a constant speed, where do we draw its acceleration? Answer: pointing from the bird to the tree!<br><br>
2. While we tend to think of normal force as oppositng gravity, that is not always the case. For example, if an object is moving around a roller coaster loop, its free-body diagram at the top of the loop will have both F<sub>g</sub> and F<sub>N</sub> pointed down. Since this coaster-cart only has centripital acceleration, F<sub>g</sub> + F<sub>N</sub> will equal mv<sup>2</sup>/r. <br> <br>
3. We can calculate the “critical speed” of an object (aka the max v before it flies off, say, a hill), by setting up a similar equation to the one above. This time, we’ll make one change: F<sub>N</sub> will point up and F<sub>g</sub> will point down, so we’ll subtract the gravitational force from the normal force to find the net force, and set it equal to mv<sup>2</sup>/r to see how high v can go before F<sub>N</sub> exceeds F<sub>g</sub> and we fly off the hill. Don’t forget to factor in friction when applicable!<br><br>


 <h2 style="text-align: center;">Inclined Planes</h2>

    <p style="text-align: left;">
    First of all, components, components, components, components. That’s what you should think when you see an inclined plane. Remember that, for example, F<sub>g</sub> is only equal to the vertical component of the normal force, not the horizontal part. And, you need to draw the normal force perpendicular to the inclined plane just as you would draw it perpendicular to a flat surface by drawing a line straight up.<br> There’s not much to say here because if you practice and keep your coordinate system clear, you’ll be good to go.
 <br><br>

 <h2 style="text-align: center;">Banked Curves</h2>
    <p style="text-align: left;">
        Banked curves combine the last two topics, planes and circular motion. You’ll see that they allow us to do things like avoid crashing when we exit a highway even if it's icy and there is no friction between your tires and the ground.
<br> <br>
1. For problems where friction never comes up: set F<sub>N</sub> - F<sub>g</sub> equal to 0 to find the normal force needed so that there is no force in the y direction (meaning make sure you only include the y component of F<sub>N</sub>) and therefore no vertical acceleration (meaning, no slipping up or down the curve). Then, plug that value of F<sub>N</sub> into a centripital force equation to solve for v. Then you’re done!<br> Keep in mind, because of the formula you end up with, increasing your speed will make you slide up the curve, and decreasing it will make you slide down.<br><br>
2. For problems where friction is involved: <br> <br>
A. first, you need to figure out which way friction points. To do this, use the steps above to see what the “speed limit” to avoid accelerating in the y direction is, and see if you’re going faster or slower. If you’re going faster, you’ll be moving up so friction will point down, and if v is slower, it’ll be the opposite scenario.

    <h2 style="text-align: center;">Atwood Machines</h2>
    <p style="text-align: left;">
        Hopefully you already know this, but atwood machines are systems with masses on a pulley attached with a string or multiple strings. For these problems, we are going to assume a) that the strings are massless, and b. that the pulleys are frictionless. We approximate massless strings because it allows us to assume that tension is the same everywhere in ths tring (write out an example net force equation to see why, and make sure to keep it simple at first, you’ll see that if the whole system accelerates together, the tension must be equal everywhere, and there must be no mass changing things). <br> <br>
To solve for any variable in an atwood machine, draw the free body diagram of things acting along the “u-axis” (the curvy one we see in the machine) horizontally, so everything lines up. This will make it easier to see which forces go where. And, you’ll sometimes have atwood machines combined with inclined planes, so it’ll be even more important to keep track of your coordinate systems. <br><p style="text-align: center;"><u>Solving Atwoods</u><br><p style="text-align: left;">
1. Draw the u-axis horizontally and keep track of what is positive and negative + left and right.<br><br>
2. Fill in forces<br><br>
3. Set up net force equations to solve.<br><br>

<br><br>Once everything is drawn out properly, it shouldn’t be too difficult to solve for what you need.
  
 <h2 style="text-align: center;">Elevators</h2>
 <p style="text-align: left;"> The two most common scenarios I see for elevator problems are: <br> <br> 1. Person standing in an elevator; in this case, the only two forces are F<sub>N</sub> up and F<sub>g</sub> down. <br> <br> 2. Something hanging from a string in the elevator; in this case, the only forces are the force of tension from the string up(F<sub>T</sub>) and F<sub>g</sub> down. DO NOT try to rationalize finding some sort of “force of elevator,” that is not a thing. The elevator part comes in when we use Newton’s 3rd law, because the acceleration will change if the elevator is accelerating, and since g is constant here, (F<sub>T</sub>)must be the thing changing.
